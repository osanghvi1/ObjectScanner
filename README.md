# ObjectScanner
In this project, we will use the newer CameraX API to add a camera preview to our app, and to enable analysis of the images streamed from the camera. Additionally, we will use Google's ML Kit to classify the images. We will do this using Google's default image classifier, without needing to know anything about machine learning.
